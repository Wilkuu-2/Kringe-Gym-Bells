Known issues: 
    You can hang on ledges, this was a feature turned into a bug, you hang on the extended lat hitbox. 
    
    Sometimes your double jumps is consumed. This might be because of a obscure bug. 
    OR You are carrying a Barbell weight, which removes your ability to double jump. 

    The effects of the items you carry are unclear. We ran out of time to make a effect indicator. 
    But you can hear the music stems change when you carry a certain item so you have that. 

    Bouncing. The physics are not well tuned for large falls. This is something not really avoidable.
